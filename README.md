# Mini-Helper
A very creative and descriptive name for the iOS application I created for doing the simple math I didn't want to grab a calculator for at 4am in the morning.

## Description
This application plays a minor, yet crucial role in my 4am shifts where I am given all the patients in the hospital and have to assign each patient one of doctors who are schedule to work- in that it does simple math to determine how many patients each doctor gets.
