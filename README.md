# Mini-Helper
A very creative and descriptive name for the iOS application I created for doing the simple math I didn't want to grab a calculator for at 4am in the morning. And for whatever reason, creating an app was easier than doing math that early in the morning.

## Description
This application plays a minor, yet crucial role in my 4am shifts where I am given all the patients in the hospital and have to assign each patient one of doctors who are schedule to work- in that it does simple math to determine how many patients each doctor gets.

## Inputs 
Input | Definition
 ------------ | ------------- 
Teams | A positive, non-zero number of teams, corresponding to the number of doctors that are on call
PatientsInput | A positive, non-zero number of patients

## Sample Outputs:

Given inputs:
- 11 teams
- 132 patients
```
For 11 teams...

ALL TEAMS get 12 patients.
```
Given inputs:
- 11 teams
- 135 patients
```
For 11 teams...
Each team gets 12 patients.
                     3 patients will be distributed as extra.
                     3 teams get 13 patients
                     8 teams get 12 patients.
```

*This application is not on the App Store. However, for 8 months, I would download it as a project on my phone and redownload it every month/2 weeks until my brain finally allowed myself to do the math without the application.*
